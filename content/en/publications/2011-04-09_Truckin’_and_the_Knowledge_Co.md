abstract: "Xerox was starting a business of selling the interlisp-D programming environment and AI workstations based on the dandelion, D0, and Dorado computers. We decided to distribute Loops with Interlisp-D and to all of the customers who were buying the workstations to develop expert systems. We decided to create a course on “knowledge programming,” explaining how to combine the various programming paradigms in Loops to create knowledge systems. Lynn Conway suggested that a competition that would energize classes for learning a computer language. The Truckin‘ knowledge competition was the equivalent of a final exam for a one-week course that we offered periodically at PARC to teach people about object-oriented programming."

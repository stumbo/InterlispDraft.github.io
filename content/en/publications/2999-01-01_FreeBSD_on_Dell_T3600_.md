abstract: "I'm a retro enthusiast who loves Lisp, so natually, I'd want to show off my Medley Interlisp virtual machine (emulating a Xerox Lisp Machine). Someone had included FreeBSD support for the project. I contributed makefiles for amd64 and aarch64 architectures. The project isn't in ports, it resides on github. Super-easy to get running on FreeBSD."

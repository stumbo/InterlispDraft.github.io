abstract: "Apparatus in a computer system provides source code analysis. The apparatus includes an analysis member which extracts programming semantics information from an input source code. The analysis member operates according to the programming language of the source code as defined by a grammar mechanism. The analysis member employs a database interface which enables the extracted programming semantics information to be placed in a user desired database for subsequent recall by a desired query system. The database and query system may be pre-existing elements which are supported by a digital processor independently of the analysis member. A relational database with an SQL query system may be used."

abstract: "LOOPSMIXIN defines several small classes that can be mixed into your application classes. It also defines the class Perspective and its support classes, which are used in the implementation of Xerox LOOPS Rules. Perspectives allow you to view one object as having more than one class at a time; they have not been tested extensively outside of Rules and are known to have major bugs which donâ€™t affect Rules, so they are not documented here."

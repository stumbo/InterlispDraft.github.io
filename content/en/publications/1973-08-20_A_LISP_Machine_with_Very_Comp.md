abstract: "This paper presents a machine designed for compact representation and rapid execution of LISP programs. The machine language is a factor of 2 to 5 more compact than S-expressions or conventional compiled code, and the compiler is extremely simple. The encoding scheme is potentially applicable to data as well as program. The machine also provides for user-defined data structures."

abstract: "The enclosed bibliography addendum includes over four hundred entries which focus primarily on recent works related to 'CyberEthics,' the 'Future of Computing' and the 'Quality of Life.' Building on the original three parts of 'A Computer Ethics Bibliography', the addendum serves as Part IV: 'CyberEthics and the Future of Computing.'  Part IV is comprised of Sections 11 and 12. Sources listed in Section 11, 'CyberEthics & Information Infrastructures,' focus on ethical and social issues related to cyberspace and the 'networked society.' Some sources in this section identify proposals and plans for designing a national and a global information infrastructure (an NII and a GII), while other sources examine issues related to 'CyberEthics'â€”i.e., the cluster of ethical, social, legal, and political issues related to the internet and networked computers.  Issues considered under the rubric 'CyberEthics' might, at first glance, seem as if they should be integrated into various sections of Part III, 'Ethical Issues in Computing.' Sources in those sections, however, consider ethical and social issues in computing that arise independently of computer networks. For example, issues related to computer monitoring, expert systems, intellectual property, software piracy, etc., arise regardless of whether computers happen to be networked to other computers or whether they function solely as 'stand-alone' systems.  Some ethical and social issues currently associated with the use of computers arise precisely because computers arenetworked. Examples of such issues include free speech, obscenity, pornography, and other so-called 'First-Amendment-related' issues in Cyberspace. Some of these 'cyber-related' issues have come to the forefront of discussion and debate among politicians, computer manufacturers, computer users, and ordinary citizens. Terms such as 'cyberpunk' and 'cyberporn,' 'cyberlove' and 'cyberadultery,' as well as 'cybercash' and 'cybersovereignity' have recently crept into our lexicon, and have come to be associated with the controversy over civil liberties in cyberspace. Sources in Section 11 address these issues.  Section 12, to be published in a future issue of Computers and Society, contains a collection of sources related to the future of computing and the quality of life. Issues concerned with technological productivity and progress, human-computer interaction and interface design, and computer use in health and human services are grouped under the heading 'quality of life.' Providing a forum to discuss such issues, ACM/SIGCAS has sponsored two symposia whose theme and title has been 'Computers and the Quality of Life.' Many of the papers which were presented at these symposia, and also published in ACM Symposia Proceedings, are cited in Section 12.  An Appendix, which lists and annotates bibliographies related to computer ethics and computers in society, is also included in the bibliography addendum. The Appendix will be published with Section 12."

abstract: "This file describes the UNICODE Lisp Library package. The UNICODE library package defines external file formats that enable Medley to read and write files where 16 bit character codes are represented as UTF8 byte sequences or big-endian UTF16 byte-pairs. It also provides for character codes to be converted (on reading) from Unicode codes to equivalent codes in the Medley-internal Xerox Character Code Standard (XCCS) and (on writing) from XCCS codes to equivalent Unicode codes."

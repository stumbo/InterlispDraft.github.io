abstract: "GITFNS provides a Medley-oriented interface for comparing the files in two different branches of a git repository. This makes it easier to understand what functions or other definitions have changed in a Lisp source file, or what text has changed in a Tedit file. This may be particularly helpful in evaluating the changes in a pull request. Separately, GITFNS also provides tools and conventions for bridging between git’s file oriented style of development and version control and Medley’s residential development style with its own version control conventions. GITFNS allows for intelligent comparisons between Lisp source files,Tedit files, and text files in a local git clone and a local Medley-style working directory, and for migrating files to and from the git clone and the working directory."

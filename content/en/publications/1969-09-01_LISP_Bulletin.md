abstract: "This first (long delayed) LISP Bulletin contains samples of most of those types of items which the editor feels are relevant to this publication. These include announcements of new (i.e. not previously announced here) implementations of LISP (or closely related) systems; quick tricks in LISP; abstracts of LISP related papers; short writeups and listings of useful programs; and longer articles on problems of general interest to the entire LISP community. Printing of these last articles in the Bulletin does not interfere with later publications in formal journals or books. Short write-ups of new features added to LISP are of interest, preferably upward compatible with LISP 1.5, especially if they are illustrated by programming examples."

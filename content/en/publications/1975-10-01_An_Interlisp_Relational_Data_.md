abstract: "This report describes the file system for the experimental large file management support system currently being implemented at SRI. INTERLISP, an interactive, development-oriented computer programming system, has been augmented to support applications requiring large data bases maintained on secondary store.  The data base support programs are separated into two levels  an advanced file system and relational data base management procedures. The file system allows programmers to make full use of the capabilities of on-line random access devices using problem related symbolic primitives rather than page and word numbers.  It also performs several useful data storage functions such as data compression, sequencing, and generation of symbols which are unique for a file."

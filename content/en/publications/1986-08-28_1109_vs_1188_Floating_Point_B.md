abstract: "The timing results below compare the performance of an 1109 vs an 1188 on a suite of floating point benchmarks. The desire was to measure as closely as possible, using TIMEALL, the relative speeds of various arithmetic opcodes. No attempt was made to benchmark a 'real' (e.g. linear algebra) application."

abstract: "PILOT is a programming system constructed  in LISP. It is designed to facilitate the  development of programs by easing the  familiar sequence: write some code, run the  program, make some changes, write some  more code, run the program again, etc. As a  program becomes more complex, making  these changes becomes harder and harder  because the implications of changes are  harder to anticipate. In the PILOT system, the  computer plays an active role in this  evolutionary process by providing the means  whereby changes can be effected  immediately, and in ways that seem natural to  the user. The user of PILOT feels that he is  giving advice, or making suggestions, to the  computer about the operation of his  programs, and that the system then performs  the work necessary. The PILOT system is  thus an interface between the user and his  program, monitoring both in the requests of  the user and operation of his program. The  user may easily modify the PILOT system  itself by giving it advice about its own  operation. This allows him to develop his own  language and to shift gradually onto PILOT the  burden of performing routine but increasingly  complicated tasks. In this way, he can  concentrate on the conceptual difficulties in  the original problem, rather than on the  niggling tasks of editing, rewriting, or adding  to his programs. Two detailed examples are  presented. PILOT is a first step toward  computer systems that will help man to  formulate problems in the same way they now  help him to solve them. Experience with it  supports the claim that such 'symbiotic  systems' allow the programmer to attack and  solve more difficult problems."

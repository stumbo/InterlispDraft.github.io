abstract: "In a graphic display system, display control software is modified to impart motion to a pop-up menu to attract the attention of the user. The menu becomes animated when a control and comparison circuit confirms that a mouse driven cursor on the screen is moving away from the pop-up menu indicating that the operator is unaware of the menu's presence. The menu moves or 'tags-along' after the cursor until the user takes notice and makes the appropriate selection."

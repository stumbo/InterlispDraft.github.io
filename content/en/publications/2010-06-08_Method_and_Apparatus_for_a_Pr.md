abstract: "A method and apparatus are described for a programming language with fully undoable, timed reactive instructions. More specifically, the present invention relates to providing a multi-modal user interface for controlling the execution of fully undoable programs. An embodiment of the present invention includes a method for providing a multi-modal user interface that is enabled to control the order of execution of a program having fully undoable instructions using checkpoints associated with discrete locations within the program."

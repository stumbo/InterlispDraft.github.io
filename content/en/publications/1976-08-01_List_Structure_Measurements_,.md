abstract: "This thesis is about list structures: how they are used in practice, how they can be moved and copied efficiently, and how they can be represented by space-saving encodings. The approach taken to these subjects is mainly empirical. Measurement results are based on five large programs written in Interlisp, a sophisticated Lisp system that runs on the PDP-10."

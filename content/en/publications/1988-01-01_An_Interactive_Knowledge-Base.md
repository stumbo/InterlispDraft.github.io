abstract: "Discusses a distributed system for humanâ€“computer interaction based on a network of computers. The system aids group problem solving by enabling participants to share in a construct elicitation process based on repertory grid techniques that have applications in education, management, and expert systems development. In education, the learner is attempting to acquire a specific construct system for the subject matter; in management, people with different construct systems are attempting to work together toward common objectives; in expert systems development, the knowledge engineer is attempting to make overt and encode the relevant construction system of an expert. The participant construct system enables individuals to interact through networked personal computers to develop mutual understanding of a problem domain through the use of repertory grid techniques.

abstract: "All SEdit editing operations and presentations are controlled by methods associated with classes of nodes in the edit tree. By defining a new class of nodes with appropriate methods, or modifying an existing class, SEdit may be configured for a wide range of editing tasks. This document describes the programming involved in defining such a class, using the basic Interlisp-D type definitions as examples."

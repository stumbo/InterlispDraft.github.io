abstract: "Abstract machine definitions have been recognized as convenient and powerful tools for enhancing software portability. One such machine, the Interlisp Virtual Machine, is examined in this thesis. We present the Multilisp System as an implementation of the Virtual Machine and discuss some of the design criteria and difficulties encountered in mapping the Virtual Machine onto a particular environment. On the basis of our experience with Multilisp we indicate several weaknesses of the Virtual Machine which impair its adequacy as a basis for a portable Interlisp System."

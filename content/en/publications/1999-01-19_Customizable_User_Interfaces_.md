abstract: "A software architecture is provided for allowing users to impart various types of button behavior to ordinary human interpretable elements of electronic documents by associating hidden persistent character string button attributes to such elements. This architecture permits such buttons to be edited and searched through the use of the edit and search routines that are ordinarily provided by standard document editors."

abstract: "Expert systems are computer programmes that can reproduce the behaviour of human experts in specific problem domains. In many places, development of expert systems is the major focus of fifth generation software projects. Accordingly, enormous amounts of resources are being spent on work in this field. Expert systems have enjoyed considerable success in many scientific and technological applications but their application in the field of management. is relatively recent.             In this article, Rekha Jain presents an overview of expert systems and addresses several issues that will be of interest to managers who are likely to consider using expert systems in their organizations."

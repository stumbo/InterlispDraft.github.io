abstract: "Interlisp IMAGEOBJs are 'objects' that know how to display themselves on IMAGESTREAMs. IMAGEOBJs are most often used to insert non-character items into a TEdit document. Standard Interlisp IMAGEOBJs are available for displaying bitmaps, graphs, and horizontal bars. Interlisp IMAGEOBJs are not objects in the sense of Loops: there is no provision for specialization of existing IMAGEOBJs and no default behavior is provided. Creation of a new type of IMAGEOBJs requires some effort. Functions must be specified for printing, reading, displaying, and handling button events for the new IMAGEOBJ type. Loops image objects are Loops objects that can be used as Interlisp IMAGEOBJs. They let the programer use the full power of the Loops environment in the creation of new IMAGEOBJs."

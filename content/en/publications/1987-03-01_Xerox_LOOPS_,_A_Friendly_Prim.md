abstract: "This primer is the equivalent of a tourist's guide book. It shows you the 'sights' but it leaves out a lot of detail. Once you are comfortable with the basic LOOPS programming concepts and procedures described here, you can use the LOOPS Reference Manual as it was intended and fully exploit the capabilities of LOOPS. This primer was written with the beginner's viewpoint in mind. it addresses strategic considerations, introduces basic procedures and methods, and provides numerous examples and pictures. The material in each chapter is presented with step-by-step instructions."

abstract: "This note provides information about font and character facilities in Interlisp-D. It is organised in two parts: 1) a user level view of the changes involved in including NS characters in Interlisp-D (adapted from the Koto release notes ({Erinyes}{$<$}doc{$>$}koto{$>$}releasenotes{$>$}*)) 2) a description of the underlying data-structures and facilities. (exported macros and fns, etc)"

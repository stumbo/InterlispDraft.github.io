abstract: "The global connectivity provided by the internet has changed the way organizations do business. One such change is the use of corporate websites to advertise products and promote customer good-will. Current website design techniques are inadequate for the creation and maintenance of effective sites. A new technique is described and demonstrated by this paper. The technique uses the NoteCards hypertext software environment. Using the technique results in websites that are easier to maintain and easier to use."

abstract: "This report describes briefly a set of display primitives that we have developed at PARC toextend the capabilities of InterLisp[l]. These primitives are designed to operate a raster-scanned display, and concentrate on facilities for placing text carefully on the display and for moving chunks of an already-created display."

abstract: "The TXDT package is a collection of INTERLISP programs designed for those who wish to build text editors in INTERLISP. TXDT provides a new INTERLISP data type, called a buffer, and programs for efficiently inserting, deleting, searching and manipulating text in buffers. Modifications may be made undoable. A unique feature of TXDT is that an address may be 'stuck' to a character occurrence so as to follow that character wherever it Is subsequently moved. TXDT also has provisions for fonts."

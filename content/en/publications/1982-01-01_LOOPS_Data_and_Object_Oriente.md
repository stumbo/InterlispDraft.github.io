abstract: "This paper summarizes the features of LOOPS and indicate how they support different knowledge representation features.  Loops is a programming system integrated into Interlisp. It includes 1) object oriented programming with non-hierarchical class structure; 2) user extendible property list descriptions of the classes, their variables, and their methods (eg. for documentation, defaults, constraints); 3) composite objects- a way for defining templates for related objects that are instantiated as a group; 4) data oriented programming using active values- a way of having a procedure invoked when the value of a vbariable is set or read; 5) a knowledge base facility providing long term storage of shared knowledge bases, support for the exchange of incremental updates (layers), and tghe representation of multiple alternatives.  This paper describes the features of LOOPS, how they facilitate implementation of a core of knowledge representation features, and our erxperience using it."

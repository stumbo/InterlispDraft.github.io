abstract: "As the need for high-speed computers increases, the need for multi-processors will be become more apparent. One of the major stumbling blocks to the development of useful multi-processors has been the lack of a good multi-processing languageâ€”one which is both powerful and understandable to programmers. Among the most compute-intensive programs are artificial intelligence (AI) programs, and researchers hope that the potential degree of parallelism in AI programs is higher than in many other applications. In this paper we propose multi-processing extensions to Lisp. Unlike other proposed multi-processing Lisps, this one provides only a few very powerful and intuitive primitives rather than a number of parallel variants of familiar constructs."

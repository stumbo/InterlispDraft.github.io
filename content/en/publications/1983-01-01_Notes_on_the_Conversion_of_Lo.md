abstract: "Conversion of the LogLispLogic programming in Lisp Artificial Intelligence programming environment from its original RutgersUCI-Lisp RUCI-Lisp implementation to an InterLisp implementation is described. This report may be useful to researchers wishing to convert LogLisp to yet another Lisp dialect, or to those wishing to convert other RUCI-Lisp programs into InterLisp. It is also intended to help users of the InterLisp version of LogLisp to understand the implementation. The conversion process is described at a level aimed toward potential translators who might benefit from approaches taken and lessons learned. General issues of conversion of Lisp software between dialects are discussed, use of InterLisps dialect translation package is described, and specific issues of non-mechanizable conversion are addressed. The latter include dialect differences in function definitions, arrays, integer arithmetic, io, interrupts, and macros. Subsequent validation, compilation, and efficiency enhancement of the InterLisp version are then described. A brief users guide to the InterLisp version and points of contact for information on LogLisp software distribution are also provided. Author"

abstract: "The HyperDesk (or 'MobyDesk') sysout is a 'Swiss Army Sysout' that includes much of the best local functionality. This includes Sketch, DictTool, PCL, CommonLens, Rooms, and Notecards. The HyperDesk-INIT file provides a powerful init file for HyperDesk. Users as well as those that may use other sysouts but would like convenient access to HyperDesk functionality. This Init file can make life easier for those who don’t hack their own init files by making it easier on those that are called in to do so. A reasonable goal is that users of this class wouldn’t need separate init files and instead will be able to tailor thier environment through a control panel and automatic profile saving."

abstract: "This module allows the 1186/Daybreak (only) users to twiddle the hardware bits so that they can have an inverting cursor (white on black and black on white instead of black on everything) and provides a patch to keep the system from undoing the effect when calling VIDEOCOLOR to reset the screen."

abstract: "Interlisp and Standard Lisp are the only Lisp dialects for which anything like a comprehensive functional specification exists. The Interlisp Virtual Machine (VM) document speaks for itself: only the highlights appear just below. The non-technical qualities of Interlisp are unique and deserve mention. Interlisp has an exhaustive and well-organized reference manual, which is available on-line to answer questions about particular functions or (to a 1esser, extent) topics. It is only through amazing amounts of labor expended on this manual that the proliferation of features in Interlisp has remained usable."

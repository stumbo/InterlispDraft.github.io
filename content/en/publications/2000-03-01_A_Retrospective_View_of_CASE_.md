abstract: "This paper provides a retrospective view of the adoption of CASE tools in organizations using some empirical data from various research studies in this field. First, relevant factors that influence the decision to adopt such a tool are discussed. Such factors include elements related to the organization adopting such a technology, as well as other characteristics associated with the application environment and the alternative development methods being used. Then, the advantages and disadvantages of using CASE tools are discussed and some critical success factors are identified. Finally, a taxonomy of CASE tools in the 90's is presented. The paper provides some explanations of why some organizations are successful in adopting CASE tools and gives recommendations for making a better use of such a technology."

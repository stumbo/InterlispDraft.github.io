abstract: "Tailoring is the technical and human art of modifying the functionality of technology while the technology is in use in the field. This position paper explores various styles of, and mechanisms for, tailoring in three research systems (Trillium, Rooms, and Buttons) created by the author to explore ways to enable players (end users) to achieve new behaviors from these systems appropriate to their particular circumstances."

abstract: "LISP, the most important of the list processing languages, was developed in the early 1960s by John McCarthy and his students while he was on the faculty of MIT. It may be characterised as a functional language, a symbolic language, a list processing language, a recursive language, and a logical language. All of these facets of LISP are studied and brought together in this book. The book is aimed at students who already know an algebraic language, such as FORTRAN or ALGOL. It is designed with a bias towards classroom teaching rather than self-teaching, although it may be used profitably in either way. There are exercises at the end of each chapter, and the answers to some of these exercises are given at the end of the book. The book has been used and tested in advanced programming courses for both undergraduate and graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley."

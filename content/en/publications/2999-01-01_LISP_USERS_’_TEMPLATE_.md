abstract: "This document provides a template and instructions for formatting the Lisp Users’ module documentation. This template applies primarily to standalone workstation users. Using the Lisp Library module TEdit, and this document, you should be able to create a standard Lisp Users’ module for the Lisp Users’ manual. This document gives you the written specifications for formatting your document. The specifications are given in the order in which you would most likely use them to format a document, with the basic text and margins described first, then the various levels of headings, then special elements such as page numbers."

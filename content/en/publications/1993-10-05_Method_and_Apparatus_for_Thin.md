abstract: "A method and apparatus are shown for improving bit-image quality in video display terminals and xerographic processors. In one embodiment, each scan line of a source image is ANDed with the scan line above to remove half-bits and thin halftones. In other embodiments, entire blocks of data are processed by bit-block transfer operations, such as ANDing a copy of the source image with a copy of itself shifted by one bit. Also, a source image can be compared to a shifted copy of itself to locate diagonal lines in order to place gray pixels bordering these lines."

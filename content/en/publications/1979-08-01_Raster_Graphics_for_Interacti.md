abstract: "Raster-scan display terminals can significantly improve the quality of interaction with conventional computer systems. The design of a graphics package to provide a “window” into the extensive programming environment of interlisp is presented. Two aspects of the package are described: first, the functional view of display output and interactive input facilities as seen by the programmer, and second, the methods used to link the display terminal to the main computer via a packet-switched computer network. Recommendations are presented for designing operating systems and programming languages so as to simplify attaching display terminals."

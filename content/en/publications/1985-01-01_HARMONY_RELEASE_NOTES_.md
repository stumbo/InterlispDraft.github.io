abstract: "These notes document features of the Harmony release of Interlisp-D. Harmony is the successor to Carol, the June 1984 release of Interlisp-D. Harmony is substantially more reliable than its predecessors: over 600 system bugs have fixed. Support for NS file and print servers is now robust and reliable. Major improvements have been made to the font system. An advanced version of Tedit, the Interlisp text editor, is being released with Harmony. Image streams, which allow for the printing of arbitrary text and graphics on Interpress and Press printers, are supported by Harmony. The following pages present detailed descriptions of these, and many other features, which constitute the Harmony release."

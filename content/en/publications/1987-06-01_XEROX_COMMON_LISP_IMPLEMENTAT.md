abstract: "The Xerox Common Lisp Implementation Notes cover several aspects of the Lyric release. In these notes you will find: • An explanation of how Xerox Common Lisp extends the Common Lisp standard. For example, in Xerox Common Lisp the Common Lisp array-constructing function make-array has additional keyword arguments that enhance its functionality. • An explanation of how several ambiguities in Steele's Common Lisp: the Language were resolved. • A description of additional features that provide far more than extensions to Common Lisp."

abstract: "In access-oriented programming, the fetching or storing of data causes user defined operations to be invoked. Annotated values, a reification of the notion of storage cell, are used to implement active values for procedural activations and properties for structural annotation. The implementation satisfies a number of criteria described for efficiency of operation, and non-interface with respect to other paradigms of programming. The access-oriented programming paradigm has been intragrated with the Loops multi-paradigm knowledge programming system which also provides function-oriented, object-oriented and rule-oriented paradigms for users."

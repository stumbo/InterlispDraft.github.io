abstract: "In 1983 the Knowledge Systems Area at Xerox PARC taught experimental courses on knowledge programming. The Truckin' knowledge competition was the final exam at the end of a one week course. Students programmed their trucks to compete in Truckin' simulation world â€” buying and selling goods, getting gas as needed, avoiding bandits, and so on. All of the trucks competed in the final. The winner was the truck with the most cash parked nearest Alice's Restaurant.  See https://www.markstefik.com/?page_id=359"

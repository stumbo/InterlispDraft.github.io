abstract: "The Interlisp-VAX project was begun in mid-1979 to provide a newer, more powerful alternative to Interlisp-10 as a LISP environment suitable for research. The result is an efficient, portable, fully functional system compatible with other Interlisps and supporting a large virtual address space. Interlisp-VAX runs under two operating systems, VMS and UNIX' . Its implementation on the VAX, one of the most popular machines in research facilities and college campuses today, assures it of a long, productive future."

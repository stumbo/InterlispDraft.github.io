abstract: "As the name suggests, LAFITEABBREV gives you the ability to refer to mail addresses using personal, easy to remember abbreviations. In addition to this rather straight forward string-to string text substitution, LAFITEABBREV will also do pattern matching using multiple wildcards in both the abbreviation and fully expanded strings."

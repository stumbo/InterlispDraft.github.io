abstract: "Shifting is the process of moving data in a storage device relative to the boundaries of the device (as opposed to moving it in and out of the device). The device in which the shift is performed is called a shift register. In order to discuss the various modes of the shift operation, we assume that the register in which the shift is to be performed is n bits wide, and number the bits from left to right, 1...n."

abstract: "An introduction to LISP is given on an elementary level. Topics covered include the programming system, 240 exercises with solutions, debugging of LISP programs, and styles of programming. More advanced discussions are contained in the following articles: Techniques using LISP for automatically discovering interesting relations in data; Automation, using LISP, of inductive inference on sequences; Application of LISP to machine checking of mathematical proofs; METEOR: A LISP interpreter for string transformations; Notes on implementing LISP for the M-460 computer; LISP as the language for an incremental computer; The LISP system for the Q-2 computer; An auxiliary language for more natural expression -- the A-language. Some applications of the utilization of the LISP programming language are given in the appendices."

abstract: "A variety of types of linkages from knowledge bases to databases have been proposed, and a few have been implemented [MW84]. In this research note, we summarize a technique which was employed in a specific context: knowledge extraction from a copy of an existing clinical database. The knowledge base is also used to drive the extracting process. RX builds causal models in its domain to generate input for statistical hypothesis verification. We distinguish two information types: knowledge and data, and recognize four types of knowledge: categorical, definitional, causal (represented in frames), and operational, represented by rules. Based on our experience, we speculate about the generalization of the approach."

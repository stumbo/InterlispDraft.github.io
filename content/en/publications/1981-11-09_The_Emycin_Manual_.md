abstract: "This manual describes a domain-independent system, called EMYCIN, for constructing one class of expert computer programs: rule-based consultants. The resulting programs use knowledge specific to a problem domain to provide consilltative advice to a client. The system-building tool, EMYCIN, is based on the domain-independent core of the MYCIN program. Domain knowledge is represented in EMYCIN systems primarily as production rules, which are applied by a goal-directed backwardchaining control structure. Fvphantom{}ules and consultation data may have associated measures of certainty, aiid incomplete data entry is allowed. The system includes an explanation facility that can display the line of reasoning followecl by the consultation program, and answer questions from the client about the contents of its knowledge base."

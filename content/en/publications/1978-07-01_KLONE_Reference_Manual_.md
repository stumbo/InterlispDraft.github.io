abstract: "KLONE is a language designed for representing conceptual knowledge. This manual is intended to serve two kinds of readers: the reader who is new to the KLONE implementation; and the reader who is familiar with KLONE, but who needs particulars of a function on occasion. Its organization accr imodates three basic kinds of lookup: getting familiar with what functions are available; deciding which function to use for some task (i.e. to see at a glance which functions might apply); and finding details of a particular function. While the manual concentrates on the third type of lookup, section 3 lists KLONE functions grouped logically; together with the introductory sections, this should facilitate the first two kinds of lookup."

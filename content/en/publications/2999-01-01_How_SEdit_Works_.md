abstract: "SEdit incorporates a variety of complex algorithms and data structures. Although the code is commented, there is no logical place within it to properly describe the use of these. Therefore this document provides an overview of the most interesting and tricky parts of the program. If you want to understand exactly what the code does, this isn’t a replacement for actually reading it. This is, however, a highly recommended introduction to the code; it’s probably not worth trying to understand the code if you haven’t read this first."

abstract: "Reuploaded from:  http://people.csail.mit.edu/riastradh...hspace{0pt} Thanks to 'lispm' on reddit for all the info:  https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comment...hspace{0pt} From what I understand SEdit was developed later than DEdit. SEdit is documented first in the 1987 Lyric release of Interlisp-D, see Appendix B: http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pd...hspace{0pt} SEdit is expanded in the virtual machine version of Interlisp-D, called Medley. See the Medley 1.0 release notes, appendix B: http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pd...hspace{0pt} Some hints for using SEdit http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pd...hspace{0pt} If you want to try it out, maybe this contains the editors: http://www2.parc.com/isl/groups/nltt/...hspace{0pt}"

abstract: "The Desert software engineering environment is a suite of tools developed to enhance programmer productivity through increased tool integration. It introduces an inexpensive form of data integration to provide additional tool capabilities and information sharing among tools, uses a common editor to give high-quality semantic feedback and to integrate different types of software artifacts, and builds virtual files on demand to address specific tasks. All this is done in an open and extensible environment capable of handling large software systems."

abstract: "We discuss the design and implementation of object-oriented datatypes for a sophisticated statistical analysis environment. The discussion draws on our experience with an experimental statistical analysis system, called DINDE. DINDE resides in the integrated programming environment of a Xerox Interlisp-D machine running LOOPS. The discussion begins with our implementation of arrays, matrices, and vectors as objects in this environment. We then discuss an additional set of objects that are based on statistical abstractions rather than mathematical ones and describe their implementation in the DINDE environment."

abstract: "This is the preliminary documentation for the first experimental version of the Test Apprentice. The purpose of this tool is to help with testing. It is eventually intended to generate and execute tests (it would be an AI application). In its current state it is just learning by watching what other testers do. But it is useful in this state because it can repeat exactly what other testers have done before."

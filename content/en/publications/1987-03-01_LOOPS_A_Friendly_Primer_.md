abstract: "This primer is the equivalent of a tourist's guide book. It shows you the 'sights' but it leaves out a lot of detail. Once you are comfortable with the basic LOOPS programming concepts and procedures described here, you can use the LOOPS Reference Manual as it was intended and fully exploit the capabilities of LOOPS. This primer was written with the beginner's viewpoint in mind. it addresses strategic considerations, introduces basic procedures and methods, and provides numerous examples and pictures. The material in each chapter is presented with step-by-step instructions. What this primer does not assume you have any previous programming experience in LOOPS, it does assume you have a Xerox 1108/9 or a Xerox 1 186 AI Workstation which is running the Cantilever version of LOOPS, and that you have experience with interlisp-D and its programming environment."

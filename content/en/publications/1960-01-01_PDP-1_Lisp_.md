abstract: "A program has been written for the PDP-1 providing a subset of the features of the LISP interpreter for the IBM 709/7090. This program, which contains no known bugs, will run on any PDP-1 with automatic divide. On machines with more than 4K of memory, it must be run in memory field 0. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with 709 LISP in general and with the LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual in particular."

abstract: "There exists the technology today to build large-scale knowledge bases haypertext system, as well as inteligent information sharing systems. As these three kinds of technologies become more widely used, the need to integrate them into generic office tools becomes more urgent for two reasons. First, each technology by itself has its limitations that will become increasingly burdensome. Second, their integration produces a synergy that can overcome their individual limitations. The goal of this paper is to articulate the synergy that arises from systems that integrate these separate technologies and to describe an implementation of such a system called Object Lens."

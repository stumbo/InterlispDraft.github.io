abstract: "The LFG Grammar-writer’s Workbench is a computational environment that assists in writing and debugging Lexical Functional Grammars (Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982). It provides linguists with a facility for writing syntactic rules, lexical entries, and simple morphological rules, and for testing and editing them."

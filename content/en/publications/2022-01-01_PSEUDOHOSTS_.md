abstract: "A pseudohost identifies the root of a file system that exists as a subdirectory of another pre-existing file system. This gives a shorthand way of operating on a file in the subdirectory of a particular project without having to specify in the name of that file the entire path to its location in a larger file system. This package implements pseudohost file devices that allow files to be specified and manipulated in this way."

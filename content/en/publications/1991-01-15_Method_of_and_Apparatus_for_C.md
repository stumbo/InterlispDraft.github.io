abstract: "An apparatus and a method are disclosed for composing an imposition in terms of an arrangement of printing plates on selected of the image positions on selected units of a printing press to print a given edition, by first assigning each section of this edition to one of the press areas. Thereafter, each printing unit is examined to determine an utilization value thereof in terms of the placement of the printing plates on the image positions and the relative number of image positions to which printing plates are assigned with respect to the total number of image positions. Thereafter, a list of the image positions for each of the sections and its area, is constructed by examining one printing unit at a time in an order according to the placement of that printing unit in the array and examining its utilization value to determine whether or not to include a particular image position of that printing unit in the list. As a result, a list of the image positions is constructed in a sequence corresponding to numerical order of the pages in the section under consideration. Finally, that list of the image positions and the corresponding section and page numbers is displayed in a suitable fashion to inform a user of how to place the printing plates in the desired arrangement onto the printing units of the press to print this given edition."

abstract: "The Medley Interlisp revival is a project to restore Medley Interlisp for use on modern computers. Interlisp began as a Lisp environment for researchers sponsored by DARPA, and after gaining display capabilities it was renamed Interlisp-D. Xerox spun out sales and development of Interlisp-D with the 'Medley' software release, which eventually became the product name. Medley development tapered off in the 1990s and was revived in 2021 by a team including many of the original PARC developers. Their effort is aimed at both preserving the Interlisp software created in the past and expanding the scope of what these tools can do to further realize the promises of interactive, graphically augmented development."

abstract: "A preliminary version of QLISP is described. QLISP permits free intermingling of QA4-like constructs with INTERLISP code. The preliminary version contains features similar to those of QA4 except for the backtracking of control environments. It provides several new features as well. This preliminary manual presumes a familiarity with both INTERLISP and the basic concepts of QA4. It is intended to update rather than replace the existing documentation of QA4."

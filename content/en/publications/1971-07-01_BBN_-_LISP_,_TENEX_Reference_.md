abstract: "This document describes the BBN-LISP system currently implemented on the DEC-PDP-10 under the BBN TENEX time sharing system. BBN-LISP is designed to provide the user access to the large cirtual memory allowed by TENEX with a relatively small penalty in speed (using special paging techniques described in Bobrow and Murphy, 1967). Additional datatypes have been added, including strings and has association tables (hash linkes). This system has been designed to be a good on-line interactive system. Some of the features provided include sophisticiated debugging facilities with tracing and conditional breakpoints, a sophisticated LISP oriented editor wihin the system, an compatible compiler and interpreter."

abstract: "Raster-scan display terminals can significantly imrpove the quality of interaction with conventional computer systems. the design of a graphics package to provide a 'window' into the extensive programming environment of Interlisp is presented. Two aspects of the package are described: first, the functional view of display output and interactive input facilities as seen by the programmer, and second, the methods used to link the display terminal to the main computer via a packet-switched computer network. Recommendations are presented for designing operating systems and programming languages so as to simplifly attaching display terminals. An appendix contains detailed documentation of the graphics package."

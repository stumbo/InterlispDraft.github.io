abstract: "The Koto release of Interlisp-D provides a wide range of added functionality, increased performance and improved reliability. Central among these is that Koto is the first release of Interlisp that supports the new Xerox 1185/1186 artificial inteilligence work stations, including the new features of these work stations such as the expanded 19' display, and the PC emulation option.  Of course, like previous releases of Interlisp, Koto also supports the other current members of the 1100 series of machines, specifically the 1132 and various models of the 1108."

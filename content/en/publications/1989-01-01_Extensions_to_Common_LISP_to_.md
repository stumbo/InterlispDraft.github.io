abstract: "This is a proposal to the X3 J13 committee for both extending and modifying the Common LISP language definition to provide a standard basis for Common LISP support of the variety of characters used to represent the languages of the international community. This proposal was created by the Character Subcommittee of X3 J13. We would like to acknowledge discussions with T. Yuasa and other members of the JIS Technical Working Group, comments from members of X3 J13, and the proposals [Ida87], [Linden87], [Kerns87], and [Kurokawa88] for providing the motivation and direction for these extensions. As all these documents and discussions were created expressly for LISP standardization usage, we have borrowed freely from their ideas as well as the texts themselves."

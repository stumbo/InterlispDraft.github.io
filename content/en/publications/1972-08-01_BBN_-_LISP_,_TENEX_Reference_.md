abstract: "This document describes the BBN-LISP system currently implemented on the DEC PDP-10 under the BBN TENEX time sharing system. BBN-LISP is designed to provide the user access to the large virtual memory allowed by TENEX, with a relatively small penalty in speed (using special paging techiques described in Bobrow and Murphy, 1967). Additional data types have been added, including strings and hash association tables (hash links). This system has been designed to be a good on-line interactive system. Some of the features provided include sophisticated debugging facilities with tracing and conditional breakpoints, a sophisticated LISP oriented editor within the system, and compatible compiler and interpreter."

abstract: "This paper describes an intelligent system to help people share and filter information communicated by computer-based messaging systems. The system exploits concepts from artificial intelligence such as frames, production rules, and inheritance networks, but it avoids the unsolved problems of natural language understanding by providing users with a rich set of semi-structured message templates. A consistent set of “direct manipulation” editors simplifies the use of the system by individuals, and an incremental enhancement path simplifies the adoption of the system by groups."

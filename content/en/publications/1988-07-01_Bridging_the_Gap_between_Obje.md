abstract: "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is highly effective for problems involving hierarchical data categorization, leveraging inheritance and data encapsulation to promote structured implementation and maintainability. However, OOP environments often lack generalized facilities for deductive retrieval and pattern matching, which are crucial for knowledge-based applications. Conversely, logic programming languages like Prolog excel in these areas with built-in deductive retrieval through backtracking and pattern matching via unification, offering a natural representation of rule-based knowledge. Despite its strengths, Prologâ€™s declarative style is awkward for inherently procedural tasks, and it lacks a robust library for graphical interfaces and user interactions. Combining object-oriented and logic programming in a multiparadigm approach could harness the strengths of both paradigms, utilizing each for its optimal tasks. This integration seeks to preserve the advantages of both OOP and logic programming, addressing the challenge of effectively merging these paradigms in a unified application."

abstract: "For the SIGPLAN conference on history of programming languages held in Los Angeles in this June, J. McCarthy had to write a paper about LISP-history (1). He was very able to do this because he has given a talk on LISP history in summer 1974 at M.I.T. (2) and has contributed since then a lot of remarks and comments to my work on compiling a complete history of our language. His paper corresponds to the state of our knowledge in May of this year (1978) before D. Park found the original LISP 1 manual (3)."

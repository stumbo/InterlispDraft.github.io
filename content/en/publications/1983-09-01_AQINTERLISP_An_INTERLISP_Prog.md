abstract: "This paper describes the operation and internal structure of a program called AQINTERLISP. AQINTERLISP is an interactive INTERLISP-10 program for generalization and optimization of discriminant descriptions of object classes. The descriptions are expressed as disjunctive normal expressions in the variable valued logic system. Such expressions are unions of conjunctive statements (complexes) involving relations on multiple-valued variables. Input data to the program are sets of VLI events (sequences of attribute-value pairs) describing individual objects. Each even is associated with a given class name."

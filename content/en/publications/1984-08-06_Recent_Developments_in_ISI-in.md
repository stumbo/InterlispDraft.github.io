abstract: "This paper reports on recent developments of the ISI- Interlisp implementation of Interlisp on a VAX computer. ISI-Interlisp currently runs under UNIX, specifically the Berkeley VM/UNIX and VMS operating systems. Particular attention is paid to the current status of the implementation and the growing pains experienced in the last few years. Included is a discussion of the conversion from UNIX to VAX/VMS, recent modifications and improvements, current limitations, and projected goals. Since much of the recent effort has concerned performance tuning, our observations on this activity are included. ISI-Interlisp, formerly known as Interlisp-VAX, was reported in 1982 ACM Symposium on LISP and Functional Programming, August 1982 [1]. Experiences and recommendations since the 1982 LISP conference are presented."

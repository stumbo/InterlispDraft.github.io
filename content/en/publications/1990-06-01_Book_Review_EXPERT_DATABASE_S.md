abstract: "Expert Database Systems (EDS) has emerged in the recent years as a powerful combination of disciplines like Artificial Intelligence, Database Management, Logic Programming, and Fuzzy System Theory. This new field incorporates the benefits of both data-based and knowledge-based systems and has generated a great interest among the research, industrial and government communities. An International Workshop on EDS was held in South Carolina in October, 1984, which became the initiative for starting a series of International Conferences on EDS. The first conference on EDS was held in April, 1986 in South Carolina. The second conference, EDS'88, was held in Virginia on April 25--27, 1988. This conference was attended by 350 participants from Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, England, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, the Soviet Union, Switzerland, and USA."

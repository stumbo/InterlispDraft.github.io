abstract: "These notes accompany the Carol Release of Interlisp-D. They describe changes made since the Fugue.4 Release of October, 1983 and the Fugue.6 Release of April, 1984. The most prominent feature is support for the Xerox 1108 local file system. A new release of TEdit provides a powerful, menudriven interface. Xerox 1100 and 1132 users can now initialize Interlisp-D from disk partitions other than the currently booted partition."

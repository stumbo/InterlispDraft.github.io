abstract: "The Common Lisp Object System is an object-oriented system that is based on the concepts of generic functions, multiple inheritance, and method combination. All objects in the Object System are instances of classes that form an extension to the Common Lisp type system. The Common Lisp Object System is based on a meta-object protocol that renders it possible to alter the fundamental structure of the Object System itself. The Common Lisp Object System has been proposed as a standard for ANSI Common Lisp and has been tentatively endorsed by X3J13."

abstract: "An Interlisp Stream is an object of datatype STREAM that is capable of performing, at the least, sequential input and/or output of bytes. Some streams can do much more. Streams are used for access to open files, for writing to the display, for chatting to remote hosts, and whatever other uses people come up with. This document describes how one goes about defining a new device, the meanings of the record fields of the STREAM and FDEV datatypes, and anything else that seemed relevant at the time."

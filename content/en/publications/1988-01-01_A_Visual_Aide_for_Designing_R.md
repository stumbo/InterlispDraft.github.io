abstract: "This paper describes a thesis project in which a visually-oriented design utility is constructed in Interlisp-D for the Xerox 1108 Artificial Intelligence Workstation. This utility aids in the design of Regular Expression Parsers by visually simulating the operation of a parser. A textual program, suitable for utilization in the construction of a compiler scanner or other similar processor may be produced by the utility."

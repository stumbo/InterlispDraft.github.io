abstract: "The present invention relates to techniques for producing the perception of a moving viewpoint within a three-dimensional space presented on a display. The invention provides techniques for operating a system to produce the perception of a moving viewpoint within a three-dimensional workspace. When the user indicates a point of interest on an object, the viewpoint can approach the point of interest asymptotically, with both radial and lateral motion. The orientation of the viewpoint can rotate to keep the point of interest in the field of view. The field of view can also be centered about the point of interest by rotating the viewpoint."

abstract: "The LOOPS (Lisp Object-Oriented Language) project was started to support development of expert systems project at PARC. We wanted a language that had many of the features of frame languages, such as objects, annotated values, inheritance, and attached procedures. We drew heavily on Smalltalk-80, which was being developed next door."

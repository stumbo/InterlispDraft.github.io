abstract: "The core of decision-making expertise in many kinds of problem solving can be expressed succinctly in terms of rules. The following sections describe facilities in Xerox LOOPS for representing rules, and for organizing knowledge-based systems with rule-oriented programming. The Xerox LOOPS rule language provides an experimental framework for developing knowledge-based systems. The rule language and programming environment are integrated with the object-oriented, data oriented, and procedure-oriented parts of Xerox LOOPS."

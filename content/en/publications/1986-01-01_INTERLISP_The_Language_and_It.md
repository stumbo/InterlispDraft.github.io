abstract: "LISP, as a language, has been around for about 25 years. It was originally developed to support artificial intelligence (AI) research. At first, it seemed to be little noticed except by a small band of academics who implemented some of the early LISP interpreters and wrote some of the early AI programs. In the early 60â€™s, LISP began to diverge as various implementations were developed for different machines. McCarthy gives a short history of its early days."

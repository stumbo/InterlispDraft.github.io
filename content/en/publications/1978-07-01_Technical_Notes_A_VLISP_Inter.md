abstract: "VCMC1 is a virtual machine designed to observe 'in vitro' the behaviour of VLISP interpreters. VCMC1 is actually entirely simulated in VLISP 10. We present a short description of the VCMC1 machine followed by the complete listing of the code of a VLISP interpreter, This interpreter incorporates the special feature for tail-recursion function calls."

abstract: "This clip looks at two examples of larger tutorial--CAI systems that were developed by the Ontario Institute for Studies and Education, and Xerox's PARC. It is from Episode 7 of the classic 1983 television series, Bits and Bytes, which starred Luba Goy and Billy Van.  It was produced by TVOntario, but is no longer available for purchase."

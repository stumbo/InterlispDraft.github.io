abstract: "X3J13 is the name of a technical committee which was part of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS, then named X3).  The X3J13 committee was formed in 1986 to draw up an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Common Lisp standard based on the first edition of the book Common Lisp the Language (also termed CLtL, or CLtL1), by Guy L. Steele Jr., which was formerly a de facto standard for the language.  The primary output of X3J13 was an American National Standard for programming language Common Lisp (X3.226/1994), approved December 8, 1994. X3J13 later worked with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) working group SC22/WG16 on an internationally standardised dialect of Lisp named ISLISP."

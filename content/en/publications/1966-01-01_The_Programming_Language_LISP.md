abstract: "Among the new languages for instructing computers is a remarkable one called LISP. The name cornes from the first three letters of LIST and the first letter of PROCESSING. Not only is LISP a language for instructing computers but it is also a formal mathematical language, in the same way as elÃ«mentary algebra when rigorously defined and used is a formal mathematical language.  LISP is designed primarily for processing data consisting of lists of symbols. It has been used for symbolic calculations in differential and integral calculus, electrical circuit theory, mathematical logic, game playing, and other fields of intelligent handling of symbols.  The purpose of the present article is to make a bridge between the ideas and terms of ordinary English and elementary mathematics, and the ideas and terms known and used by LISP programmers."

abstract: "Program verification refers to the idea that the intent or effect of a program can be stated in a precise way that is not a simple 'rewording' of the program itself, and that one can prove (in the mathematical sense) that a program actually conforms to a given statement of intent. This thesis describes a software system which can verify (prove) some non-trivial programs automatically. The system described here is organized in a novel manner compared to most other theorem-proving systems. IL has a great deal of specific knowledge about integers and arrays of integers, yet it is not 'special-purpose', since this knowledge is represented in procedures which are separate from the underlying structure of the system. It also incorporates some knowledge, gained by the author from both experiment and introspection, about how programs are often constructed, and uses this knowledge to guide the proof process. It uses its knowledge, plus contextual information from the program being verified, to simplify the theorems dramatically as they are being constructed, rather than relying on a super-powerful proof procedure. The system also provides for interactive editing of programs and assertions, and for detailed human control of the proof process when the system cannot produce a proof (or counter-example) on its own."

abstract: "Effective information access involves rich interactions between users and information residing in diverse locations. Users seek and retrieve information from the sources—for example, file serves, databases, and digital libraries—and use various tools to browse, manipulate, reuse, and generally process the information. We have developed a number of techniques that support various aspects of the process of user/information interaction. These techniques can be considered attempts to increase the bandwidth and quality of the interactions between users and information in an information workspace—an environment designed to support information work (see Figure 1)."

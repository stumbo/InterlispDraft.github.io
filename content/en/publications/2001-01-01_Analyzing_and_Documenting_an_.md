abstract: "Corporate websites are an important component in the world-wide web. The traditional way of creating these websites leads to a variety of structural problems that reduce the effectiveness of the websites. These problems are difficult to locate and correct using the ad hoc analysis methods that currently exist. This paper introduces a new technique to analyze and document websites. The technique uses the NoteCards hypertext environment to build a visual model of the website. The model is semantically rich, dynamically extensible, and allows interactive update. The result of using this technique is a website that is easier to use, easier to update, and fully documented. The technique is described and demonstrated on a small website."

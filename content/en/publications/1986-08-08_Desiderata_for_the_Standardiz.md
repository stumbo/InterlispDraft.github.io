abstract: "This paper reports work-in-progress within the LISP community on efforts to bring the LISP language to national and international standardisation. The paper discusses the objective criteria that have been established, how it is planned that these will be satisfied, when it is expected these will be fulfilled and what it still open. The Common LISP definition has made a very valuable contribution to the standardisation of LISP and the current authors have learned much from that experience. The result is a rationale for how LISP could be standardised along with identification of key features in the language and its environment, which together lead to a layered definition. This is followed by detail of the proposal for LISP standardisation based on the strategies that will have been outlined."

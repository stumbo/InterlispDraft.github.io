abstract: "The Dipmeter Advisor is a knowledge-base system, linked to a computer work-station, designed to aid in the interpretation of dipmeter results through interaction between the interpreter and the 'expert' system. The system utilizes dipmeter results, other wireline log data, computer processed results such as LITHO*, and user-input local geological knowledge as the framework for the interpretation. A work session proceeds through a number of phases, which leads to first a structural, then a stratigraphic interpretation of the well data. Conclusions made by the Dipmeter Advisor can be accepted, modified, or rejected by the interpreter at any stage of the work session. The user may also make his own conclusions and comments, which are stored as part of the final interpretation and become part of an updated knowledge-base for input to further field studies."

abstract: "Abstract: This paper describes an inference system which lends itself to graphical representation. An implementation of the system is described, and its application in a legislation based domain is illustrated. The methodology for knowledge elicitation which the system is intended to support is briefly indicated. The algorithm is described, and semantics for the system are given."
